    The video above shows the initial gameplay of the embedded 2048 implementation running on the OLED display. It captures the startup screen followed by the first few directional inputs, demonstrating smooth tile movement, merging logic, and real-time updates on the display.

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    This project implements the popular puzzle game <strong>2048</strong> on the
    TI CC3200 embedded microcontroller. The game runs fully on-device, rendering
    the board on an Adafruit SSD1351 OLED display and allowing input via either
    UART or accelerometer-based tilt control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Core features include:
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time tile movement and merging</li>
      <li>Random tile spawning</li>
      <li>OLED rendering with dynamic number formatting</li>
      <li>Accelerometer tilt input handling with debounce logic</li>
      <li>Post-game score submission to AWS IoT via HTTPS</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Planned features like temperature-based tile coloring were scoped but not implemented due to hardware integration constraints.
  </p>

    The GIF above captures a full game session from start to finish. It showcases the tile merging mechanics, increasing tile values, and ends with the game-over screen, where the final score and largest tile are reported and sent to AWS IoT.
